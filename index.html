<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This web map contains a variety of locations that have significance in my life across New Zealand. I decided to make the territorial authorities grey because I did not want them to attract more attention than was needed hence why I also made them fairly faded, where as my polygon I made red so it would pop. The baseman colours and symbols where selected to give the map a unique feel. I made the background light pink while making the industrial areas more red so I would be identifiable without adding too much contrast. I made vegetation areas a darker green so they would pop as they are more important to my points of interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
